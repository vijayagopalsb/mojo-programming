# Mojo Core Overview
Mojo is a high-performance programming language and it is designed for AI/ML and System Programming.
It combines Python syntax and usability, and of course with C++ level speed and performance.
It is built on **MLIR** (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) for getting optimum hardware acceleration.

## Key Features

- **Python compatible:** Mojo leverages Python syntax with extra keywords (fn, var, let)
- **Zero cost abstractions:** Optimized for hardware like CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.   (*Note: GPU: Graphics Processing Unit, TPU: Tensor Processing Unit*)
- **Auto-tuning:** Compiler optimizes for your hardware.
- **Memory safety:** Borrow checker (like Rust) for safe low-level code.
